# Fake_News_Detection_Using_Machine Learning
# Fake news has become a significant issue, especially on social media and online news platforms. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify news articles as fake or real based on textual content. By Natural Language Processing (NLP it helps computers understand human language) and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation.
